MJ12Monitor
===========
This provides an API for accessing a node's crawling stats. It currently outputs to the command line, but an http server will be added in the near future to display stats, and graphs from all nodes. It will also enable control of nodes.

How to Use:

1. Download: https://github.com/xur17/MJ12Monitor/downloads

2. Extract to some directory

3. Edit settings.conf. Comment out username and password if unused, and add as many servers as you want.

4. Use the command line to navigate to the extracted directory

5. Run 'python server.py' to start your server. Information will be displayed in the command window.
